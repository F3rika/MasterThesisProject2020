# MasterThesisProject2020
The present repository contains some of the Python3 scripts and CWL workflows I produced during my master thesis internship project.  
All the scripts/workflows were tested/applied and can be considered functioning, however they are still quite rough and there is still room for their improvement and polishing.  
For this reasons consider this repository as a personal archive.
